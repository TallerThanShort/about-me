# About Me
Elo, I'm TTS (**CKS3**)

I like to code random stuff in **C languages** (C, C++, C#) and I make things happen in HTML.
I know how to code some basic js stuff and I'm learning rust atm. I also started coding in SYSlang recently.

I generally hate life, suck at making anything good and don't eat enough...

I sell Consumer Products...

I also like to make music, *ok?*

Oh, and I bought Discord Nitro for 2 boost for the PolySpace server, and gave some random kids Nitro Classic.
