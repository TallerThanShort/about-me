# About Me
Elo, I'm TTS (**CKS3**)

I like to code random stuff in **C languages** (C, C++, C#) and I make things happen in HTML.

I generally hate life...

I like to crash the internet...

I sell Consumer Products...

I also like to make music, *ok?*

Oh, and new item on this list: Bought Nitro for 2 boost for the PolySpace server.
