# About Me
Elo, I'm TTS (**CKS3**)

I like to code random stuff in **C languages** (C, C++, C#) and I make things happen in HTML.
I also started coding in SYSlang recently.

I generally hate life, suck at making anything good and don't eat enough...

I sell Consumer Products...

I also like to make music, *ok?*

Oh, and new item on this list: bought Discord Nitro for 2 boost for the PolySpace server.

## Projects I curate:
- [OpenSource uTube](https://github.com/CKStudios2018/OpenSource-uTube)
- [LoopyOS](https://github.com/CKStudios2018/LoopyOS)
