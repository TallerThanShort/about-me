# About Me
Elo, I'm TTS (**CKS3**)

I like to code random stuff in **C languages** (C, C++, C#) and I make things happen in HTML. **I AM NOT A PROGRAMMER**

I also like to do some photoshopping, play Minecraft (check out [my VarietySMP gameplay](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC0ZN6JJKZxe_KnAuq664AlETPl4n3a8H)), and make music, and have recently done some SEO in WordPress, Joomla! and ReadyMag.
